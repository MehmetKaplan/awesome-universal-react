# Awesome Universal React [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A collection of awesome universal React and React Native frameworks, libraries, design systems, apps and resources.

## What is Universal React?

Universal React apps are cross-platform React and React Native apps using "React
Native for Web" to use the same API for UI components. They run on iOS, Android and Web. They share the same navigation, styles, state management and business logic -- but they run natively on each platform and respect the platform conventions and best practices.
